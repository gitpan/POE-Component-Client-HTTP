--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Client::HTTP is an asynchronous, event driven HTTP
user agent.  It accepts events containing HTTP::Request objects, and
it returns events carrying HTTP::Response objects.  It supports https
and simultaneous HTTP transactions.

------------
Requirements
------------

POE::Component::Client::HTTP requires http://poe.perl.org/ to be
available.  Transient network problems (or testing the module from a
disconnected machine) may cause it to fail.

This module requires POE, HTTP::Request, and HTTP::Response.  The
requirements are encoded in Makefile.PL, so the CPAN shell should do
the right thing.  If this is installed without the CPAN shell, the
person installing it will have to do the right thing manually.

SSL (https) support requires Net::SSLeay::Handle.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Client::HTTP may be installed through the CPAN shell
in the usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Client::HTTP'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Client::HTTP

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Client::HTTP

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::Client::HTTP can also be installed manually.
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror should hold the latest
version.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The test programs, t/01_get.t and t/02_put.t, make excellent sample
programs.  If you would like to see more details about the tests'
operations, edit them and set their DEBUG constants to any value Perl
considers "true".

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
