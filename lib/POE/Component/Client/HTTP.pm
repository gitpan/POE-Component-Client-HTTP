=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::Client::HTTP is an HTTP user-agent for POE.  It lets
other sessions run while HTTP transactions are being processed, and it
lets several HTTP transactions be processed in parallel.

If POE::Component::Client::DNS is also installed, Client::HTTP will
use it to resolve hosts without blocking.  Otherwise it will use
gethostbyname(), which may have performance problems.

HTTP client components are not proper objects.  Instead of being
created, as most objects are, they are "spawned" as separate sessions.
To avoid confusion (and hopefully not cause other confusion), they
must be spawned with a C<spawn> method, not created anew with a C<new>
one.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 spawn

PoCo::Client::HTTP's C<spawn> method takes a few named parameters:

=over 2

=item Agent => $user_agent_string

=item Agent => \@list_of_agents

If a UserAgent header is not present in the HTTP::Request, a random
one will be used from those specified by the C<Agent> parameter.  If
none are supplied, POE::Component::Client::HTTP will advertise itself
to the server.

C<Agent> may contain a reference to a list of user agents.  If this is
the case, PoCo::Client::HTTP will choose one of them at random for
each request.

=item Alias => $session_alias

C<Alias> sets the name by which the session will be known.  If no
alias is given, the component defaults to "weeble".  The alias lets
several sessions interact with HTTP components without keeping (or
even knowing) hard references to them.  It's possible to spawn several
HTTP components with different names.

=item ConnectionManager => $poco_client_keepalive

C<ConnectionManager> sets this component's connection pool manager.
It expects the connection manager to be a reference to a
POE::Component::Client::Keepalive object.  The HTTP client component
will call C<allocate()> on the connection manager itself so you should
not have done this already.

  my $pool = POE::Component::Client::Keepalive->new(
    keep_alive    => 10, # seconds to keep connections alive
    max_open      => 100, # max concurrent connections - total
    max_per_host  => 20, # max concurrent connections - per host
    timeout       => 30, # max time (seconds) to establish a new connection
  );

  POE::Component::Client::HTTP->spawn(
    # ...
    ConnectionManager => $pool,
    # ...
  );

See L<POE::Component::Client::Keepalive> for more information.

=item CookieJar => $cookie_jar

C<CookieJar> sets the component's cookie jar.  It expects the cookie
jar to be a reference to a HTTP::Cookies object.

=item From => $admin_address

C<From> holds an e-mail address where the client's administrator
and/or maintainer may be reached.  It defaults to undef, which means
no From header will be included in requests.

=item MaxSize => OCTETS

C<MaxSize> specifies the largest response to accept from a server.
The content of larger responses will be truncated to OCTET octets.
This has been used to return the <head></head> section of web pages
without the need to wade through <body></body>.

=item NoProxy => [ $host_1, $host_2, ..., $host_N ]

=item NoProxy => "host1,host2,hostN"

C<NoProxy> specifies a list of server hosts that will not be proxied.
It is useful for local hosts and hosts that do not properly support
proxying.  If NoProxy is not specified, a list will be taken from the
NO_PROXY environment variable.

  NoProxy => [ "localhost", "127.0.0.1" ],
  NoProxy => "localhost,127.0.0.1",

=item Protocol => $http_protocol_string

C<Protocol> advertises the protocol that the client wishes to see.
Under normal circumstances, it should be left to its default value:
"HTTP/1.1".

=item Proxy => [ $proxy_host, $proxy_port ]

=item Proxy => $proxy_url

=item Proxy => $proxy_url,$proxy_url,...

C<Proxy> specifies one or more proxy hosts that requests will be
passed through.  If not specified, proxy servers will be taken from
the HTTP_PROXY (or http_proxy) environment variable.  No proxying will
occur unless Proxy is set or one of the environment variables exists.

The proxy can be specified either as a host and port, or as one or
more URLs.  Proxy URLs must specify the proxy port, even if it is 80.

  Proxy => [ "127.0.0.1", 80 ],
  Proxy => "http://127.0.0.1:80/",

C<Proxy> may specify multiple proxies separated by commas.
PoCo::Client::HTTP will choose proxies from this list at random.  This
is useful for load balancing requests through multiple gateways.

  Proxy => "http://127.0.0.1:80/,http://127.0.0.1:81/",

=item Streaming => OCTETS

C<Streaming> changes allows Client::HTTP to return large content in
chunks (of OCTETS octets each) rather than combine the entire content
into a single HTTP::Response object.

By default, Client::HTTP reads the entire content for a response into
memory before returning an HTTP::Response object.  This is obviously
bad for applications like streaming MP3 clients, because they often
fetch songs that never end.  Yes, they go on and on, my friend.

When C<Streaming> is set to nonzero, however, the response handler
receives chunks of up to OCTETS octets apiece.  The response handler
accepts slightly different parameters in this case.  ARG0 is also an
HTTP::Response object but it does not contain response content,
and ARG1 contains a a chunk of raw response
content, or undef if the stream has ended.

  sub streaming_response_handler {
    my $response_packet = $_[ARG1];
    my ($response, $data) = @$response_packet;
    print SAVED_STREAM $data if defined $data;
  }

=item FollowRedirects => $number_of_hops_to_follow

C<FollowRedirects> specifies how many redirects (e.g. 302 Moved) to
follow.  If not specified defaults to 0, and thus no redirection is
followed.  This maintains compatibility with the previous behavior,
which was not to follow redirects at all.

If redirects are followed, a response chain should be built, and can
be accessed through $response_object->previous(). See HTTP::Response
for details here.

=item Timeout => $query_timeout

C<Timeout> specifies the amount of time a HTTP request will wait for
an answer.  This defaults to 180 seconds (three minutes).

=back

=head1 ACCEPTED EVENTS

Sessions communicate asynchronously with PoCo::Client::HTTP.  They
post requests to it, and it posts responses back.

=head2 request

Requests are posted to the component's "request" state.  They include
an HTTP::Request object which defines the request.  For example:

  $kernel->post(
    'ua', 'request',           # http session alias & state
    'response',                # my state to receive responses
    GET 'http://poe.perl.org', # a simple HTTP request
    'unique id',               # a tag to identify the request
    'progress',                # an event to indicate progress
    'http://1.2.3.4:80/'       # proxy to use for this request
  );

Requests include the state to which responses will be posted.  In the
previous example, the handler for a 'response' state will be called
with each HTTP response.  The "progress" handler is optional and if
installed, the component will provide progress metrics (see sample
handler below).  The "proxy" parameter is optional and if not defined,
a default proxy will be used if configured.  No proxy will be used if
neither a default one nor a "proxy" parameter is defined.

=head2 pending_requests_count

There's also a pending_requests_count state that returns the number of
requests currently being processed.  To receive the return value, it
must be invoked with $kernel->call().

  my $count = $kernel->call('ua' => 'pending_requests_count');

=head2 cancel

Cancel a specific HTTP request.  Requires a reference to the original
request (blessed or stringified) so it knows which one to cancel.  See
L<progress handler> below for notes on canceling streaming requests.

To cancel a request based on its blessed HTTP::Request object:

  $kernel->post( component => cancel => $http_request );

To cancel a request based on its stringified HTTP::Request object:

  $kernel->post( component => cancel => "$http_request" );

=head2 shutdown

Responds to all pending requests with 408 (request timeout), and then
shuts down the component and all subcomponents.

=head1 SENT EVENTS

=head2 response handler

In addition to all the usual POE parameters, HTTP responses come with
two list references:

  my ($request_packet, $response_packet) = @_[ARG0, ARG1];

C<$request_packet> contains a reference to the original HTTP::Request
object.  This is useful for matching responses back to the requests
that generated them.

  my $http_request_object = $request_packet->[0];
  my $http_request_tag    = $request_packet->[1]; # from the 'request' post

C<$response_packet> contains a reference to the resulting
HTTP::Response object.

  my $http_response_object = $response_packet->[0];

Please see the HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response manpages for more
information.

=head2 progress handler

The example progress handler shows how to calculate a percentage of
download completion.

  sub progress_handler {
    my $gen_args  = $_[ARG0];    # args passed to all calls
    my $call_args = $_[ARG1];    # args specific to the call

    my $req = $gen_args->[0];    # HTTP::Request object being serviced
    my $tag = $gen_args->[1];    # Request ID tag from.
    my $got = $call_args->[0];   # Number of bytes retrieved so far.
    my $tot = $call_args->[1];   # Total bytes to be retrieved.
    my $oct = $call_args->[2];   # Chunk of raw octets received this time.

    my $percent = $got / $tot * 100;

    printf(
      "-- %.0f%% [%d/%d]: %s\n", $percent, $got, $tot, $req->uri()
    );

    # To cancel the request:
    # $_[KERNEL]->post( component => cancel => $req );
  }

=head3 DEPRECATION WARNING

The third return argument (the raw octets received) has been deprecated.
Instead of it, use the Streaming parameter to get chunks of content
in the response handler.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

POE::Component::Client::HTTP uses two standard environment variables:
HTTP_PROXY and NO_PROXY.

HTTP_PROXY sets the proxy server that Client::HTTP will forward
requests through.  NO_PROXY sets a list of hosts that will not be
forwarded through a proxy.

See the Proxy and NoProxy constructor parameters for more information
about these variables.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This component is built upon HTTP::Request, HTTP::Response, and POE.
Please see its source code and the documentation for its foundation
modules to learn more.  If you want to use cookies, you'll need to
read about HTTP::Cookies as well.

Also see the test program, t/01_request.t, in the PoCo::Client::HTTP
distribution.

=head1 BUGS

There is no support for CGI_PROXY or CgiProxy.

Secure HTTP (https) proxying is not supported at this time.

There is no object oriented interface.  See
L<POE::Component::Client::Keepalive> and
L<POE::Component::Client::DNS> for examples of a decent OO interface.
