    Return a "400 Bad Request" error if we're redirected to a URI with a
    bad scheme.

    Sean Brunnock reported the issue when a link redirected his program
    to <htttp://...>. This triggered an internal confess() we had put
    there to trap a strange case we couldn't reproduce. His test case and
    patch were instrumental in helping me resolve this on a deeper level.

    [rt.cpan.org 76542] Fix a double close in PoCo::Client::HTTP.

    Florian Schlichting found POE throwing an error on an undefined file
    descriptor. POE::Component::Client::HTTP was closing a filehandle
    before destroying the wheel that was managing it. When it was time
    for the wheel to remove the filehandle's watcher, fileno() failed,
    and trouble ensued.

    [rt.cpan.org 77601] Switch to Socket's getaddrinfo().

    AVENJ reported that Socket::GetSockAddr's :newapi was deprecated.
    Switch to Socket for a more future-proof API.

    [rt.cpan.org 76543] Help out Debian with a NAME and SYNOPSIS for an
    internal module.

    Florian sent in a patch written by Krzysztof Krzyzaniak to add NAME
    and SYNOPSIS sections to
    POE::Component::Client::HTTP::RequestFactory. This is reported to
    help Debian automatically build a "whatis" entry for the module.
    Thanks for the patch! Please send any others upstream.
