    Time for another release.

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/57_joel_immed_cancel.t M;

  2008-07-09 19:44:56 (r332) by martijn; t/04_chunk_filter.t M

    forget about reading from DATA. This way we can control how much data
    we feed to the filter, so we get better coverage. 

  2008-07-09 19:44:41 (r331) by martijn; t/04_chunk_filter.t M

    de-poe-ify 04_chunk_filter.t too. 

  2008-07-09 19:44:21 (r330) by martijn; t/03_head_filter.t M

    get coverage up to same level as with the old tests. 

  2008-07-09 19:44:07 (r329) by martijn; t/03_head_filter.t M

    stop using POE while testing Filter::HTTPHead.

    Release time! 

  2008-04-20 00:26:49 (r322) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Apply Kim Scheibel's patch to support a BindAddress parameter. Useful
    for running on multi-homed machines. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket
    34837. 

  2008-04-19 22:56:52 (r321) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Apply Yuri Karaban's patch to avoid losing responses when a redirect
    fails. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 25577. 

  2008-04-19 22:46:23 (r320) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Filter/HTTPChunk.pm M; lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Apply Yuri Karaban's patch to respond correctly if the server closes
    connection before sending headers. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 25920. 

  2008-03-25 07:51:12 (r319) by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPHead.pm M

    Apply Jeffrey Posnick's patch to support duplicate headers. Before
    his patch, subsequent headers of the same type would overwrite
    previous ones. For example, a second Cookie header would clobber the
    first. Resolves rt.cpan.org 27262. 

  2008-03-25 07:42:11 (r318) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Apply Dan Sterling's patch to use Time::HiRes when it's available. He
    was running into premature timeouts when using subsecond timeouts.
    Resolves rt.cpan.org 30466. 

  2008-03-24 18:05:00 (r317) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    a fix for a common noisy POE::Kernel trap. 

  2008-03-24 18:03:29 (r316) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Apply Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp's patch to not pass cookies across
    redirects. Previously cookie headers would bleed with a redirect,
    which is extremely bad. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 30400. 

  2008-03-24 17:53:15 (r315) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Apply Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp's suggestion not to bail out of
    redirect if we reach the same URL twice. It was doing the wrong thing
    with certain site authentication schemes. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket
    30399. 

  2008-03-24 17:44:53 (r314) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    (they count!). Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 30401. 

  2007-08-17 13:54:25 (r313) by andyg; t/59_andy_one_keepalive.t A
