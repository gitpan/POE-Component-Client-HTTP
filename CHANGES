  2006-07-13 06:43:38 (r265) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Update the POE dependency, per Adam Kennedy's feedback. 

  2006-07-13 06:42:47 (r264) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Document the ConnectionManager per Joel Bernsein's patch (plus
    Jonathan Steinert's POD correction). Bump up the version for a
    release.

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Doc patch for Joel Bernstein. It wasn't terribly clear that he could
    cancel a request based on the stringified version of the
    HTTP::Request object reference. Now I hope it is. 

  2006-07-04 16:12:19 (r262) by rcaputo; t/54_hzheng_head_redir.t M

    Resolve an issue where the target site redirects a variable number of

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; MANIFEST M; t/11_cancel.t A

    Added a cancel command, which may be used to cancel a specific HTTP
    request. Useful for stopping HTTP streams without shutting down the
    entire component. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 5292.
    
    Bumped the version to 0.76 for a new release.

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; MANIFEST M;

    Remove unnecessary includes (POSIX among others). Resolves
    rt.cpan.org ticket #18922 [guest].
    
    Added a shutdown() method. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #12685. Thanks
    to Fabricio Martínez for the request.
    
    Documented the need for individual-request shutdown. 

  2006-05-16 20:48:55 (r256) by woggle
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Fix potential memory leak by removing in more cases wheel_to_request
    entries when the corresponding request goes away.

    Fix problem where we might generate two reply events when we got

  t/55_reiss_double_resp.t A; Makefile.PL M; t/52_reiss_bad_length.t M;
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Close the connection when we abort reading the response in the middle
    (includes redirects and requests over the maximum length); fixes
    broken behavior where we might reuse the socket and take the rest of
    the response as our new response. This requires new functionality in
    PoCoCliKeepalive, so update Makefile.PL to reflect that.

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/09_bad_scheme.t M;

    Modify some tests to make sure that $response->request() is defined
    in more obscure cases (various internal error returns, etc.) and fix
    some cases where it is not so the new tests pass. 

  2006-05-10 05:19:12 (r252) by woggle; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPHead.pm M

    Ryan Tate posted in <http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=539816> about a
    problem with timeouts. It turns out that when redirects created new
    internal requests, the old ones weren't being cleaned up. As a
    result, they had to time out before the component would stop. Thanks
    to Tony Cook for pointing me at this message.
    
    Also beefed up the debugging a little, and bumped up the version for
    a new release.

  2006-03-24 05:24:48 (r245) by rcaputo; t/09_bad_scheme.t A

    Forgot to commit this. It tests that bad schemes don't kill the

    Some tests require specific proxy environments. Especially the tests

    something else to a proxy server.

    Applied Yuri Karaban's patch to unconditionally invalidate a socket

    Increase the timeouts to 60 seconds. This should not affect most
    people, as we expect the tests to pass relatively quickly. A

    quickly on his dialup in Thailand. This resolves his rt.cpan.org

    A mostly anonymous guest reported that Apache 1.3 doesn't follow

  2005-09-08 17:48:08 (r214) by rcaputo; RequestFactory.pm M

    Add a Content-Length header if a request has content but no
    Content-Length. I'm not sure this is the right thing to do in all

  2005-09-01 13:59:29 (r212) by rcaputo; HTTP.pm M

    Yuri Karaban fixed redirects to use the proxy of the original

    Charles Reiss patched the HTTP head parser to support HTTP/0.9
    content-only responses. He added a test to t/53_response_parser.t,
    and suggested a required change in t/03_head_filter.t. It used a
    content-only message as a bad response, and suddenly it was good.
    Something had to be done. 

  2005-08-04 04:45:38 (r207) by rcaputo; HTTP.pm M

    This commit fixes an error where the Filter::Stackable is empty when
    Transfer-Encoding's last (i.e. first) coding marker is not supported.
    It also documents the order that Transfer-Encoding's codings are
    parsed in.
    
    It also documents a bug in HTTP/0.9 parsing. The bug relates to the
    failing test in t/53_response_parser.t circa changeset:205.

  MANIFEST M; t/53_response_parser.t A

    Created a new regression test framework for HTTP parser issues that
    do return some type of response. This is a superset of the
    functionality of t/52_reiss_bad_length.t, and perhaps the tests from
    that file should be ported forward into this one. 

  2005-08-02 19:14:09 (r204) by rcaputo; HTTP.pm M; RequestFactory.pm M

    Applied Yuri Karaban's patch to support a different proxy for

    We require the absolute latest PoCo::Client::Keepalive. 

  2005-08-02 15:17:49 (r201) by rcaputo; HTTP.pm M

    Update the Transfer-Encoding logic to preserve unknown encodings and
    any that come later than the first one. It still uses pop(), which
    assumes that encodings are read right-to-left. We're not sure if
    that's correct, however. 

  2005-08-02 14:24:42 (r200) by rcaputo
  HTTPChunk.pm M; t/04_chunk_filter.t M

    Yuri Karaban discovered that chunk lengths with trailing whitespace
    weren't being recognized. The result was responses with empty

  2005-07-27 04:12:22 (r194) by rcaputo
  MANIFEST M; t/52_reiss_bad_length.t A

    Charles Reiss provided a test case for bad content-length headers.

  2005-07-27 02:56:15 (r193) by rcaputo; t/01_request.t M; HTTP.pm M

    Charles Reiss pointed out that invalid URLs, such as "http:bad" would
    cause the component to die rather than throw an error with code 400.
    His patch, applied here, corrects this oversight. 

  2005-07-24 22:00:50 (r192) by rcaputo; HTTP.pm M

  2005-07-24 21:01:55 (r190) by rcaputo; t/02_keepalive.t M

    I seem to have broken the keepalive test in a previous commit. This
    fixes up the requests so the chain of responses matches expectations. 

  2005-07-24 18:55:42 (r189) by rcaputo; Request.pm M; HTTP.pm M

    Add in a hard die() if an active timer is overwritten. This is a big
    problem, as the old timer will still fire if it hasn't been removed
    previously.
    
    Set the request's REQ_TIMER to undef in remove_timeout() so multiple
    calls to it won't attempt to alarm_remove() the timer again.
    
    Replace a $request->timer(undef) call with
    $request->remove_timeout(). Setting the timer to undef does not call
    alarm_remove(), but remove_timeout() does this necessary magic. 

  2005-07-08 04:06:16 (r188) by rcaputo; t/02_keepalive.t M

    Removed the last of the foreign web sites from the keep-alive tests.

    report, rt.cpan.org #13557, was very detailed and included a working
    test case that has become t/50_davis_zerolength.t. 

  2005-07-07 14:33:04 (r184) by rcaputo; t/02_keepalive.t M

    Clean up some of the URLs left over in this test. Other URLs are

  2005-07-07 14:30:58 (r183) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Remove the repository URL from svn-log.perl's command line. The
    utility is smart enough to figure it out on its own now.
