  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Release 0.78. 

  2006-09-26 04:00:21 (r276) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Apply a fix by Harish J P at Yahoo. He found a race condition where
    cleanup is sometimes performed twice on a request. The component
    would try to call methods on undefined data members the second time
    around, which is fatal. Resolves rt.cpan.org 21110. 

  2006-09-26 03:56:52 (r275) by rcaputo; t/58_joel_cancel_multi.t M

    Display more information if one of the tests fails. 

  2006-09-25 17:32:57 (r274) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Remove trailing whitespace. 

  2006-09-25 17:16:03 (r273) by rcaputo; t/08_discard.t M

    Apply a patch by Tony Cook that avoids a test hang when running under
    the CPAN shell. It sets an http_proxy environment variable, but the
    test only deleted the all-uppercase version. 

  2006-09-25 17:13:25 (r272) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/57_joel_immed_cancel.t M

    Fix a typo in the is_shut_down flag that Tony Cook discovered.
    Resolves rt.cpan.org 20452. 

  2006-09-25 10:22:30 (r271) by joel
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/58_joel_cancel_multi.t M

    fixed request-cancellation code to pass tests where request is
    cancelled before the connection manager successfully connects

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/58_joel_cancel_multi.t A;

    Add Joel Bernstein's test.

  t/57_joel_immed_cancel.t A; t/57_joel_rt21172.t D

    Make the filename descriptive. 

  2006-09-05 16:39:48 (r268) by rcaputo
  MANIFEST M; t/57_joel_rt21172.t A

    Add a test case for rt.cpan.org ticket 21172, reported by Joel
    Bernstein. 

  2006-08-31 04:30:29 (r267) by rcaputo
  t/10_shutdown.t A; t/11_cancel.t M

    Add a test that I forgot to include in subversion. Flag some files as
    keyword-expanding.

=========================

  2006-07-13 06:43:38 (r265) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Update the POE dependency, per Adam Kennedy's feedback. 

  2006-07-13 06:42:47 (r264) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Document the ConnectionManager per Joel Bernsein's patch (plus
    Jonathan Steinert's POD correction). Bump up the version for a
    release. 

  2006-07-12 19:39:56 (r263) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Doc patch for Joel Bernstein. It wasn't terribly clear that he could
    cancel a request based on the stringified version of the
    HTTP::Request object reference. Now I hope it is. 

  2006-07-04 16:12:19 (r262) by rcaputo; t/54_hzheng_head_redir.t M

    Resolve an issue where the target site redirects a variable number of
    times depending on your location.

  2006-07-02 17:54:51 (r260) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; MANIFEST M; t/11_cancel.t A

    Added a cancel command, which may be used to cancel a specific HTTP
    request. Useful for stopping HTTP streams without shutting down the
    entire component. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 5292.
    
    Bumped the version to 0.76 for a new release.

  2006-05-21 21:08:33 (r258) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Document the shutdown message, and bump the version for a new
    release. 

  2006-05-21 21:05:32 (r257) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; MANIFEST M;
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Remove unnecessary includes (POSIX among others). Resolves
    rt.cpan.org ticket #18922 [guest].
    
    Added a shutdown() method. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #12685. Thanks
    to Fabricio Martínez for the request.
    
    Documented the need for individual-request shutdown. 

  2006-05-16 20:48:55 (r256) by woggle
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Fix potential memory leak by removing in more cases wheel_to_request
    entries when the corresponding request goes away. 

  2006-05-11 20:48:14 (r255) by woggle
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; MANIFEST M; t/56_redirect_excess.t
  A

    Fix problem where we might generate two reply events when we got
    extra junk after a redirect and add test case for it.

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; MANIFEST M;
  t/55_reiss_double_resp.t A; Makefile.PL M; t/52_reiss_bad_length.t M;
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Close the connection when we abort reading the response in the middle
    (includes redirects and requests over the maximum length); fixes
    broken behavior where we might reuse the socket and take the rest of
    the response as our new response. This requires new functionality in
    PoCoCliKeepalive, so update Makefile.PL to reflect that. 

  2006-05-10 05:20:55 (r253) by woggle
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/09_bad_scheme.t M;
  t/52_reiss_bad_length.t M; lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Modify some tests to make sure that $response->request() is defined
    in more obscure cases (various internal error returns, etc.) and fix
    some cases where it is not so the new tests pass. 

  2006-05-10 05:19:12 (r252) by woggle; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPHead.pm M

    Make this inherit from POE::Filter to be compatible with subversion
    POE.

    Ryan Tate posted in <http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=539816> about a
    problem with timeouts. It turns out that when redirects created new
    internal requests, the old ones weren't being cleaned up. As a
    result, they had to time out before the component would stop. Thanks
    to Tony Cook for pointing me at this message.
    
    Also beefed up the debugging a little, and bumped up the version for
    a new release.

  examples A; lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/RequestFactory.pm M; MANIFEST

    Added a test case by Toby Ovod-Everett from rt.cpan.org ticket
    #18339. Fixed some tab damage, and corrected a typo.

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/54_hzheng_head_redir.t M;
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Resolved rt.cpan.org ticket #14679 by Hao Zheng. Ignoring
    content-length headers for HEAD requests, especially since google.com
    sends them. 

  2006-03-24 05:34:32 (r247) by rcaputo
  MANIFEST M; t/55_hzheng_empty_content.t D

    This test case isn't needed. Now I gotta remove it. D'oh. 

  2006-03-24 05:34:01 (r246) by rcaputo
  MANIFEST M; t/55_hzheng_empty_content.t A

    Commit a test case for rt.cpan.org ticket #15025. Except that the
    ticket is moot---a previous fix also resolved this issue. D'oh. 

  2006-03-24 05:24:48 (r245) by rcaputo; t/09_bad_scheme.t A

    Forgot to commit this. It tests that bad schemes don't kill the
    component outright. 

  2006-03-24 05:18:16 (r244) by rcaputo
  MANIFEST M; t/54_hzheng_head_redir.t A

    Added a test case for Hao Zheng's bug report, rt.cpan.org ticket

  2006-03-23 23:47:14 (r243) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Document the lack of https proxying as a bug.

  t/01_request.t M; t/08_discard.t M; t/53_response_parser.t M;
  t/07_proxy.t M

    Some tests require specific proxy environments. Especially the tests
    that include a localhost web server, because "localhost" may mean
    something else to a proxy server. 

  2006-03-23 23:45:08 (r241) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/RequestFactory.pm M

    We currently don't support https proxying. Bypass proxying for https
    requests. Resolves part of rt.cpan.org ticket #16675. 

  2006-03-23 23:44:21 (r240) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Follow redirects for bodiless responses. Resolves part of rt.cpan.org
    ticket #16675. 

  2006-03-23 14:56:16 (r239) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; MANIFEST M

    Applied Yuri Karaban's test case and patch for a fatal error that
    occurred when giving the component URLs with schemes it could not
    handle. This resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #17599. 

  2006-03-17 05:46:48 (r238) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    David Davis' friend patched this so it would work with MSN.
    Essentially, force the request to be finished after headers on a HEAD
    response, certain response codes, or 0-length replies.

    Avoid warnings if proxying without a host header. 

  2006-01-07 23:14:28 (r234) by rcaputo; t/01_request.t M

    Skip SSL tests if POE::Component::SSLify isn't loaded. Thanks to
    Andrew Chen for spotting the error. 

  2005-09-19 02:22:02 (r233) by rcaputo; .releaserc A

    Beginning to use Module::Release for releases.
