  2003-06-30 03:06:40 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.38

    Applied Ask Bjoern Hansen's patch to move Host checking before we
    reset the host for proxying. This improves Client::HTTP's cooperation
    with proxies (specifically squid, in Ask's case). 

=========================
2003-05-04 06:08:08 v0_53
=========================

  2003-05-04 06:08:08 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.37; Makefile.PL 1.16

    Update version numbers in requisite modules and itself. 

  2003-05-03 01:39:28 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.36

    Various minor stylistic tweaks while hunting down an error that
    eventually turned out to be in POE::Wheel::SocketFactory. 

  2003-05-02 20:20:19 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.35

    Removed the shutdown() code. In extended tests, it was causing some
    servers to disconnect before sending HTTP responses.

    Added code to match comments. If an HTTP request contains a UserAgent
    header, use that instead of writing over it with one of ours. This
    allows proxies written with this component to pass on proper values. 

  2003-05-02 12:58:19 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.15

    Update the revisions of things we require. 

  2003-05-02 12:57:19 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.34

    Use shutdown() to signal the end of a request. Requires POE 0.2501 or
    newer. 

=========================
2003-03-14 06:09:41 v0_52
=========================

  2003-03-14 06:09:41 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.33

    Bump the version number to 0.52 for release. 

===========================

===========================

  2003-03-10 17:42:10 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.32

    Bump version to 0.5102. 

  2003-03-10 17:40:53 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.31

    Mike Mindel found a server that emits the status line as a single
    entity and the response headers as another. This broke the newline
    detection code and discarded the status line altogether. Fixed. 

===========================
2003-03-08 04:36:32 v0_5101
===========================

  2003-03-08 04:36:32 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.30

    Mike Mindel discovered that the DNS timeout was hardcoded to 90
    seconds no matter what the HTTP component's timeout was set to. Fixed
    the use of PoCo::Client::DNS so that requests don't take longer than
    the specified timeout.

    Added a commissioned feature: Requests may be load balanced through
    multiple proxies, chosen at random from a list.

    Added a commissioned feature: User-agent strings may be chosen at
    random from a list. 

  2003-02-28 04:47:31 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.29

    (!!! May break backward compatibility !!!) Applied Ilya Martynov's
    patch to replace HTTP::Headers with HTTP::Response during streaming
    content. This is unfortunately necessary because HTTP::Headers does
    not include the status code, so you can't tell whether the request
    was successful. While this changes the public interface, it does not
    break the existing tests. We obviously need better tests, then.

  2002-12-02 21:03:32 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.28

    I aborted an upload of 0.50 because I had forgotten to tag the files
    for CHANGES. Unfortunately, PAUSE registered the upload before I
    could stop it, so to upload a good version I need to burn a version
    number. Blah, but the security feature is understandable. 

=========================

=========================

  2002-12-02 20:54:56 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.27

    Applied Prakash Kailasa's patch to omit port 80 from the Host header.
    The original patch also omitted 443 for https, but that broke test 8
    (https). The modified patch being committed works for all tests. 

=========================
2002-10-21 01:16:54 v0_49
=========================

  2002-10-21 01:16:54 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.26

    Increase version to 0.49 for release. 

  2002-10-21 00:41:46 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.25; t/01_request.t 1.12

    Fix signal handlers before POE 0.24 creates warnings for them. 

  2002-09-10 03:33:21 by rcaputo
  HTTP.pm 1.24; Makefile.PL 1.14; SSL.pm 1.4

    Update contact e-mail addresses.

=========================

  2002-09-07 21:52:20 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.23

    Bump the version to 0.48 for release. 

  2002-09-07 21:50:07 by rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.11

    Added a test for streamed content, which required me to create a CGI
    that streamed some content.

    Enabled the MaxSize test, since we now have a large stream of content
    to test it against. 

  2002-09-07 21:48:32 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.22

    Appied Averell's patch to return streamed content in chunks rather
    than attempting to load them entirely into memory before returning
    them. Documented his patch too.

    Documented the MaxSize parameter while I was documenting things.

    Tidy up the internal implementation in trivial ways. 

  2002-09-07 21:43:50 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.13

    Require a contemporary version of POE, rather than one which is more
    than two years old. 

=========================

=========================

  2002-09-04 20:33:26 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.21

    Thibaut B discovered that Domino Go servers will send multi-line
    STATUS lines (probably in addition to multi-line headers). The
    component hadn't anticipated that, but now it's fixed. 

  2002-09-04 20:31:22 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.12

    Move to the new CVS log reporter. 

  2002-07-19 15:26:59 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.20

    Removed a spurious warn() left over from debugging. Bumped the
    version number to 0.46. 

=========================

=========================

  2002-07-10 16:04:32 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.11

    Mexnix noticed the POE::Kernel run() warning in Makefile.PL. This fix
    gets rid of that warning. 

  2002-07-10 15:27:17 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.19

    Increase the version to 0.45. 

  2002-07-10 15:26:49 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.18

    Generate HTTP 500 errors for https requests without Net::SSLeay, and
    for failed DNS lookups. Improve Net::SSLeay detection (watch the
    versions of modules as well as their presence). 

  2002-07-10 15:25:31 by rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.10

    Skip the SSL test if Net::SSLeay isn't installed. 

  2002-07-10 15:24:45 by rcaputo; SSL.pm 1.3

    Fix indenting. Nothing really changed here but whitespace. 

  2002-07-10 15:24:18 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.6; Makefile.PL 1.10

    Make Net::SSLeay an optional dependency, not a mandatory one. Add in
    AutoInstall to make things easier. 

=========================
2002-07-10 05:22:50 v0_44
=========================

  2002-07-10 05:22:50 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.9

    Add a recent version of Net::SSLeay to Client::HTTP's dependencies.
    The dependencies include a recent version of Net::SSLeay::Handle, but
    it seems that isn't enough. 

  2002-07-10 05:21:40 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.17

    Randal Schwartz gave a compelling reason for Client::HTTP to do
    nonblocking lookups internally. This change adds that feature. 

  2002-07-10 02:30:19 by rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.9

    Add a test case for Randal Schwartz's uncanonical URI bug. 

  2002-07-10 00:43:33 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.16

    Randal Schwartz noticed that Client::HTTP did not canonicalize URIs
    it's given. This fix does that. 

  2002-07-04 13:33:28 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.15

    Bump the version to 0.43 for release. 

  2002-07-04 13:33:03 by rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.8

    I forgot to test for Net::SSLeay::Handle before testing https. The
    result? Mondo crashage at the CPAN testers. Oy! 

=========================
2002-07-03 05:14:04 v0_42
=========================

  2002-07-03 05:14:04 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.14; README 1.4

    Prepare for 0.42 release. 

  2002-07-03 03:55:16 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.13

    No noticeable changes. Everything I tried was simply ineffectual. 

  2002-07-02 21:33:39 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.12

    Update the User-Agent string slightly to follow Mozilla's format.
    Adds (rv:$VERSION) to the string.
