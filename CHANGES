    Avoid having two different HTTP version numbers in the response
    status line.

    Addresses a condition where response objects reported their status as
    "HTTP/0.9 200 OK HTTP/1.1".

    Consolidate connection closing code.

    Makes connection shutdown a little more consistent. Also fixes a bug
    where the wrong object ID was used to look up part of the connection
    state.

    Provide a dummy version number for development testing.

    The default connection string is based on the component version,
    which stopped being defined in-house since the move to Dist::Zilla.
    Tests were noisy and ugly with moot "uninitialized value" warnings.

    On a shutdown, deallocate the proper keep-alive connection ID.

    It was deallocating the PoCo::Client::HTTP request ID, which isn't
    coupled to the PoCo::Client::Keepalive ID at all.

    The problem wasn't apparent before because IDs were coincidentally in
    synch. Recent changes finally desynchronized them.

    Honor "Connection: close" response header by closing the connection.

    Without closing the connection, POE::Component::Client::Keepalive
    would put the connection back into its pool and detect closure when
    the server later shut down the socket.

    Nicolas Dehaine and Brad Sacks discovered this to be a problem when
    they tried to make a lot of rapid connections to a single address.
    The to-be-defunct connection didn't have enough time to shut down, so
    it would be returned to POE::Component::Client::HTTP. The HTTP
    transaction would then fail, and an error would be reported.

    Their test case allowed me to repeat the problem and diagnose it.
    Otherwise this would still be broken. Thanks, guys!

    Clean up some constant definitions. No change in functionality.

    Bypass proxies for tests that make localhost connections.

    Localhost is relative, and it's often not what's expective when
    proxying is turned on without an exception for it.
