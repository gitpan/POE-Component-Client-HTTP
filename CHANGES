	* Makefile.PL: Add a recent version of Net::SSLeay to
	Client::HTTP's dependencies.  The dependencies include a recent
	version of Net::SSLeay::Handle, but it seems that isn't enough.

2002-07-10 05:21  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm: Randal Schwartz gave a compelling reason for
	Client::HTTP to do nonblocking lookups internally.  This change
	adds that feature.

2002-07-10 02:30  rcaputo

	* t/01_request.t: Add a test case for Randal Schwartz's uncanonical
	URI bug.

2002-07-10 00:43  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm: Randal Schwartz noticed that Client::HTTP did not
	canonicalize URIs it's given.  This fix does that.

2002-07-04 13:33  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm: Bump the version to 0.43 for release.

2002-07-04 13:33  rcaputo

	* t/01_request.t: I forgot to test for Net::SSLeay::Handle before
	testing https.	The result?  Mondo crashage at the CPAN testers. 
	Oy!

2002-07-03 05:14  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm, README: Prepare for 0.42 release.

2002-07-03 03:55  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm: No noticeable changes.  Everything I tried was simply
	ineffectual.

2002-07-02 21:33  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm: Update the User-Agent string slightly to follow
	Mozilla's format.  Adds (rv:$VERSION) to the string.

2002-06-29 06:19  rcaputo

	* SSL.pm: Remove WRITE (which is in Net::SSLeay::Handle) and do
	some other little cleanups.

2002-06-29 06:10  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm, t/01_request.t: Cosmetic change that may facilitate
	changes later.

2002-06-29 05:50  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm, MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, SSL.pm, t/01_request.t: Add SSL
	support.  https URLs should now be fetchable, albeit slowly.

2002-06-29 05:49  rcaputo

	* README: Note that the tests require a working internet
	connection.

2002-06-09 18:45  rcaputo

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed the CHANGES generation so that change logs are
	included in tarballs.

2002-06-09 18:45  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm, t/01_request.t: Applied Ryan Briones' proxying support. 
	Thanks, Ryan!  Added a GET test (with parameters) to ensure that
	GET and POST parameters pass through proxies.

2002-06-09 03:53  rcaputo

	* Makefile.PL: Added a dependency for URI version 1.11.  Newer
	versions of LWP require an interface change that exists in 1.11 but
	not in previous versions.

2002-05-22 04:00  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm: Apply ekkis' patch to add the request tag to the
	progress callback.

2002-05-19 02:47  rcaputo

	* Makefile.PL: "make dist" fails if it can't find CHANGES (which is
	in the MANIFEST).  Add a little bit of code to ensure CHANGES
	exists before "make dist" can happen.

2002-05-18 17:03  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Removed CHANGES from the repository since it's now
	generated from CVS's commit log.

2002-05-18 17:02  rcaputo

	* MANIFEST: Added CHANGES.OLD, so people can see old stuff.

2002-05-18 17:02  rcaputo

	* Makefile.PL: Added "make dist" magic to auto-generate ./CHANGES
	with the last year's worth of changes.

2002-05-18 16:59  rcaputo

	* CHANGES.OLD: Moved the old, hand-edited CHANGES to CHANGES.OLD. 
	When the newest thing in it becomes a year old, it will be removed.

2002-05-18 16:58  rcaputo

	* HTTP.pm: Implemented the Timeout parameter.  Fixed content length
	calculations.  Replaced deprecated FooState parameters with
	FooEvent.

2001-12-06 16:21  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, HTTP.pm, t/01_request.t: add code behind Timeout

2001-10-15 19:43  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, HTTP.pm, t/01_request.t: add maxsize ability
