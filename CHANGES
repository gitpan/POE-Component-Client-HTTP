  2003-10-30 23:21:30 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.43

    Bump version for release. 

  2003-10-19 20:02:36 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.42

    Add preliminary support for HTTP::HeadParser, which should better
    update base() and related headers in the HTTP::Response objects. 

  2003-10-19 20:01:55 by rcaputo; SSL.pm 1.5

    Alter the READ (and add a WRITE) function so they better follow the
    sysread() and syswrite() interfaces. 

  2003-10-19 20:01:09 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.19

    Update the current versions of dependencies I have been testing with. 

  2003-10-19 16:31:10 by rcaputo
  Makefile.PL 1.18; mylib/ExtUtils/AutoInstall.pm 1.1

    Upgrade ExtUtils::AutoInstall to 0.54 

  2003-10-17 05:11:01 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.41

    Alan Hasting discovered an error in the bitmap for the redirect phase
    of HTTP parsing. This should fix that error.

    Also we are now using delay_adjust() since it's available in POE
    0.27. This should avoid the potential for bad timeouts during long
    downloads. 

  2003-10-17 05:09:27 by rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.15

    Remove some debugging code. 

  2003-10-17 05:08:49 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.17

    We are now relying on a feature of POE 0.27. Bump up the dependency
    version number.

=========================

  2003-08-19 19:07:17 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.40; t/01_request.t 1.14

    Applied Averell Dalton's redirect patch, which is loosely based on
    Prakash Kailasa's original patch. Averell's version includes a flag
    to enable redirect following and to limit the number of redirects
    that will be followed. 

  2003-07-27 19:51:48 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.39; t/01_request.t 1.13

    Apply Ask Bjoern Hansen's accessor patch so programs can find out how
    many requests are pending. Bumped the version number to 0.55 for the
    next release.

2003-06-30 03:06:40 v0_54
=========================

  2003-06-30 03:06:40 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.38

    Applied Ask Bjoern Hansen's patch to move Host checking before we
    reset the host for proxying. This improves Client::HTTP's cooperation
    with proxies (specifically squid, in Ask's case). 

=========================

=========================

  2003-05-04 06:08:08 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.37; Makefile.PL 1.16

    Update version numbers in requisite modules and itself. 

  2003-05-03 01:39:28 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.36

    Various minor stylistic tweaks while hunting down an error that
    eventually turned out to be in POE::Wheel::SocketFactory. 

  2003-05-02 20:20:19 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.35

    Removed the shutdown() code. In extended tests, it was causing some
    servers to disconnect before sending HTTP responses.

    Added code to match comments. If an HTTP request contains a UserAgent
    header, use that instead of writing over it with one of ours. This
    allows proxies written with this component to pass on proper values. 

  2003-05-02 12:58:19 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.15

    Update the revisions of things we require. 

  2003-05-02 12:57:19 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.34

    Use shutdown() to signal the end of a request. Requires POE 0.2501 or
    newer.

=========================

  2003-03-14 06:09:41 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.33

    Bump the version number to 0.52 for release.

===========================

  2003-03-10 17:42:10 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.32

    Bump version to 0.5102. 

  2003-03-10 17:40:53 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.31

    Mike Mindel found a server that emits the status line as a single
    entity and the response headers as another. This broke the newline
    detection code and discarded the status line altogether. Fixed. 

===========================
2003-03-08 04:36:32 v0_5101
===========================

  2003-03-08 04:36:32 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.30

    Mike Mindel discovered that the DNS timeout was hardcoded to 90
    seconds no matter what the HTTP component's timeout was set to. Fixed
    the use of PoCo::Client::DNS so that requests don't take longer than
    the specified timeout.

    Added a commissioned feature: Requests may be load balanced through
    multiple proxies, chosen at random from a list.

    Added a commissioned feature: User-agent strings may be chosen at
    random from a list. 

  2003-02-28 04:47:31 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.29

    (!!! May break backward compatibility !!!) Applied Ilya Martynov's
    patch to replace HTTP::Headers with HTTP::Response during streaming
    content. This is unfortunately necessary because HTTP::Headers does
    not include the status code, so you can't tell whether the request
    was successful. While this changes the public interface, it does not
    break the existing tests. We obviously need better tests, then.

    I aborted an upload of 0.50 because I had forgotten to tag the files
    for CHANGES. Unfortunately, PAUSE registered the upload before I
    could stop it, so to upload a good version I need to burn a version
    number. Blah, but the security feature is understandable. 

=========================
2002-12-02 20:54:56 v0_50
=========================

  2002-12-02 20:54:56 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.27

    Applied Prakash Kailasa's patch to omit port 80 from the Host header.
    The original patch also omitted 443 for https, but that broke test 8
    (https). The modified patch being committed works for all tests.
