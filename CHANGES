    [rt.cpan.org 76542] Fix a double close in PoCo::Client::HTTP.

    Florian Schlichting found POE throwing an error on an undefined file
    descriptor. POE::Component::Client::HTTP was closing a filehandle
    before destroying the wheel that was managing it. When it was time
    for the wheel to remove the filehandle's watcher, fileno() failed,
    and trouble ensued.

    [rt.cpan.org 77601] Switch to Socket's getaddrinfo().

    AVENJ reported that Socket::GetSockAddr's :newapi was deprecated.
    Switch to Socket for a more future-proof API.

    [rt.cpan.org 76543] Help out Debian with a NAME and SYNOPSIS for an
    internal module.

    Florian sent in a patch written by Krzysztof Krzyzaniak to add NAME
    and SYNOPSIS sections to
    POE::Component::Client::HTTP::RequestFactory. This is reported to
    help Debian automatically build a "whatis" entry for the module.
    Thanks for the patch! Please send any others upstream.

    [rt.cpan.org 70268] Some DNS providers redirect bad hosts.

    They redirect bad hosts instead of allowing outright failure. I think
    it's supposed to be helpful, or improve domain sales, or both, or
    something. But anyway, it meant that people using certain DNS
    providers wouldn't be able to cleanly test this distribution.

    Thanks to "blackcode" for reporting this. Unfortunately I'm not sure
    of a foolproof solution other than to make the test accept 303s.

    Patches are welcome, dear reader from the future.

    Shut down user agents in tests so they end more promptly.

    Allow response events to be objects.

    Reflex::POE::Event objects are intended to be used as POE events. For
    it to work, components like this one must treat events as opaque
    data.
