  2003-07-27 19:51:48 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.39; t/01_request.t 1.13

    Apply Ask Bjoern Hansen's accessor patch so programs can find out how
    many requests are pending. Bumped the version number to 0.55 for the
    next release. 

=========================
2003-06-30 03:06:40 v0_54
=========================

  2003-06-30 03:06:40 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.38

    Applied Ask Bjoern Hansen's patch to move Host checking before we
    reset the host for proxying. This improves Client::HTTP's cooperation
    with proxies (specifically squid, in Ask's case). 

=========================
2003-05-04 06:08:08 v0_53
=========================

  2003-05-04 06:08:08 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.37; Makefile.PL 1.16

    Update version numbers in requisite modules and itself. 

  2003-05-03 01:39:28 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.36

    Various minor stylistic tweaks while hunting down an error that
    eventually turned out to be in POE::Wheel::SocketFactory. 

  2003-05-02 20:20:19 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.35

    Removed the shutdown() code. In extended tests, it was causing some
    servers to disconnect before sending HTTP responses.

    Added code to match comments. If an HTTP request contains a UserAgent
    header, use that instead of writing over it with one of ours. This
    allows proxies written with this component to pass on proper values. 

  2003-05-02 12:58:19 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.15

    Update the revisions of things we require. 

  2003-05-02 12:57:19 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.34

    Use shutdown() to signal the end of a request. Requires POE 0.2501 or
    newer.

=========================

  2003-03-14 06:09:41 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.33

    Bump the version number to 0.52 for release.

===========================

  2003-03-10 17:42:10 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.32

    Bump version to 0.5102. 

  2003-03-10 17:40:53 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.31

    Mike Mindel found a server that emits the status line as a single
    entity and the response headers as another. This broke the newline
    detection code and discarded the status line altogether. Fixed. 

===========================
2003-03-08 04:36:32 v0_5101
===========================

  2003-03-08 04:36:32 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.30

    Mike Mindel discovered that the DNS timeout was hardcoded to 90
    seconds no matter what the HTTP component's timeout was set to. Fixed
    the use of PoCo::Client::DNS so that requests don't take longer than
    the specified timeout.

    Added a commissioned feature: Requests may be load balanced through
    multiple proxies, chosen at random from a list.

    Added a commissioned feature: User-agent strings may be chosen at
    random from a list. 

  2003-02-28 04:47:31 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.29

    (!!! May break backward compatibility !!!) Applied Ilya Martynov's
    patch to replace HTTP::Headers with HTTP::Response during streaming
    content. This is unfortunately necessary because HTTP::Headers does
    not include the status code, so you can't tell whether the request
    was successful. While this changes the public interface, it does not
    break the existing tests. We obviously need better tests, then.

    I aborted an upload of 0.50 because I had forgotten to tag the files
    for CHANGES. Unfortunately, PAUSE registered the upload before I
    could stop it, so to upload a good version I need to burn a version
    number. Blah, but the security feature is understandable.

=========================

  2002-12-02 20:54:56 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.27

    Applied Prakash Kailasa's patch to omit port 80 from the Host header.
    The original patch also omitted 443 for https, but that broke test 8
    (https). The modified patch being committed works for all tests. 

=========================
2002-10-21 01:16:54 v0_49
=========================

  2002-10-21 01:16:54 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.26

    Increase version to 0.49 for release. 

  2002-10-21 00:41:46 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.25; t/01_request.t 1.12

    Fix signal handlers before POE 0.24 creates warnings for them.

  HTTP.pm 1.24; Makefile.PL 1.14; SSL.pm 1.4

    Update contact e-mail addresses.

=========================

  2002-09-07 21:52:20 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.23

    Bump the version to 0.48 for release. 

  2002-09-07 21:50:07 by rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.11

    Added a test for streamed content, which required me to create a CGI
    that streamed some content.

    Enabled the MaxSize test, since we now have a large stream of content
    to test it against. 

  2002-09-07 21:48:32 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.22

    Appied Averell's patch to return streamed content in chunks rather
    than attempting to load them entirely into memory before returning
    them. Documented his patch too.

    Documented the MaxSize parameter while I was documenting things.

    Tidy up the internal implementation in trivial ways. 

  2002-09-07 21:43:50 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.13

    Require a contemporary version of POE, rather than one which is more
    than two years old. 

=========================
2002-09-04 20:33:26 v0_47
=========================

  2002-09-04 20:33:26 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.21

    Thibaut B discovered that Domino Go servers will send multi-line
    STATUS lines (probably in addition to multi-line headers). The
    component hadn't anticipated that, but now it's fixed. 

  2002-09-04 20:31:22 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.12

    Move to the new CVS log reporter.
