  commit e08485f54654c7c639dff95cdcfb030289112634
  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date:   Sun Jul 26 23:01:30 2009 +0000
  
    Resolve a long-standing debate between MaxSize and Content-Length
    headers. If the Content-Length is greater than MaxSize, or the length
    of the content is (in the case where there is no Content-Length
    header), then we return a 406 Not Acceptable error rather than
    truncated data.

    Users who want truncated data should issue range requests instead of
    relying upon MaxSize. Besides, MaxSize won't let you resume your
    request where it left off.

    Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 26874.

    Internal component errors are sometimes indistinguishable from
    external server errors. Add a bit of text to differentiate them.

    Add PRAVUS' test case and patch to return progress events even after
    a redirect. Resolves his rt.cpan.org ticket, #36627.

  Date:   Thu Feb 19 04:00:21 2009 +0000
  
    Resolve rt.cpan.org #41278, reported by Andreas J. KÃ¶nig. The
    component test was timing out on his smoker, so I increased the
    timeout.

  Date:   Wed Feb 18 17:43:15 2009 +0000
  
    Resolve rt.cpan.org #35951, reported by Dave Miller. We were passing
    Tag to POE::Component::Client::Request->new() when it wasn't
    necessary.

  commit 1c655dbd46f0446463519179bd7fae88b96b9b22
  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date:   Wed Feb 18 17:36:32 2009 +0000
  
    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket #27643. When a server disconnects before
    responding, POE::Component::Client::HTTP returns a 406 error to the
    application. The "MaxSize" error was incorrect and has been replaced
    with "Server response is Not Acceptable". The surrounding logic has
    been simplified somewhat as well.

    Clean up several warnings introduced by recent POE changes.

    Apply Zhurs' patch to resolve rt.cpan.org tickets 43073 and 25855.
    POE::Filter::HTTPChunk would go into an infinite loop on bad chunk
    trailer data, but now it appears to be fixed. Thank you!

    Doc fix. Client::DNS is used by Client::Keepalive and is currently
    not optional.
