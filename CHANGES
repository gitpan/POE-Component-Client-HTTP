    t/02_keepalive.t was incorrectly matching responses to their
    corresponding tests. The result was a near-infinite loop between
    tests 6 and 7. This commit resolves that issue, shaving about 120
    seconds off the tests.
    
    t/01_request.t ambiguously used GET and POST. I added parens so that
    the parameters are explicit.
    
    HTTP.pm wasn't passing a timeout parameter from the request through
    to Client::Keepalive. I thought this might also result in tests that
    ran longer than they should. Anyway, it seems to be more proper
    behavior.

    Add Id tags, and set the svn:keywords property on files. Changed the
    tabbed indents to hard spaces, and tidy up the resulting mess.

    The SSL dependencies moved over to POE::Component::Client::Keepalive,
    so we were able to remove ExtUtils::AutoInstall (and the entire mylib
    directory). Cleaned up the MANIFEST and Makefile.PL to reflect that.
    
    Modified Makefile.PL to use svn-log.perl instead of cvs-log.perl.
    
    Removed CHANGES and META.yml from the repository since they're
    automatically generated at "make dist" time.

    Simplified the preparation of the DATA filehandle for use with
    Wheel::Readwrite. Worked around a bizarre case where BSD derived
    operating systems would immediately EOF on the first sysread() from
    DATA. Oddly enough, Martijn's code does essentially the same thing
    but on a duplicated filehandle. Using DATA directly seems to fix it.

    Matt Cashner and an unidentified AOL Employee that some call... Tim
    pointed out that SSL wasn't working. "But it was for me!" I said. So
    we hunted it down to an incorrect bitwise operator in the
    set-it-blocking code for non-ActiveState Perl versions prior to
    5.8.0. This bug TOTALLY BROKE SSL for these Perl versions, just going
    to show that you can't test too much or on too many platforms. Or
    something.
