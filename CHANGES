  2004-10-02 15:37:11 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.58

    Bump version to 0.65 for release. 

  2004-10-01 04:04:39 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.57

    David Davis discovered that HTTP response headers may be discarded if
    they are incomplete at the end of a read buffer. This commits a fix
    for his findings: Don't discard the remaining read buffer if we're
    still processing headers.

  2004-07-13 18:03:43 by rcaputo; mylib/ExtUtils/AutoInstall.pm 1.2

    Upgrade the included ExtUtils::AutoInstall. 

  2004-07-13 18:02:37 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.56

    Oh, duh. Increase the version number for a new release. 

  2004-07-13 18:01:56 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.55

    Matt Cashner and an unidentified AOL Employee that some call... Tim
    pointed out that SSL wasn't working. "But it was for me!" I said. So
    we hunted it down to an incorrect bitwise operator in the
    set-it-blocking code for non-ActiveState Perl versions prior to
    5.8.0. This bug TOTALLY BROKE SSL for these Perl versions, just going
    to show that you can't test too much or on too many platforms. Or
    something. 

  2004-05-02 19:42:43 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.54

    Scott Beck reported that the streaming code uses two different hash
    keys for the same heap member. This patch makes them consistent, and
    it resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #5810. 

  2004-05-02 19:25:25 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.53

    Applied Scott Beck's patch to handle interrupted status lines. This
    commit resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #5816.

    Applied Graham Barr's suggestions to (a) use Time::HiRes if it's
    available for better timeout accuracy, and (b) return an error 408
    (not 400) when a connection times out.

  2004-02-23 23:24:31 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.51; Makefile.PL 1.20

    Matt Cashner pointed out that HTTP.pm uses a feature from a recent
    version of POE. Makefile.PL specified the correct version for
    ExtUtils::AutoInstall, but it had the old version for
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker. This commit bumps the version to 0.62 for
    release, and it uses the same set of mandatory dependencies for both
    installer libraries. 

  2004-02-13 02:16:09 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.50

    A comment and another internal test are added.

=========================

  2004-01-15 21:04:51 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.49

    Apply Graham Barr's patch to accept HTTP status codes without
    messages. Uses HTTP::Status to generate a default message in this
    case. 

=========================
2004-01-14 19:21:53 v0_60
=========================

  2004-01-14 19:21:53 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.48

    Bump the release version to 0.60. 

  2004-01-14 19:21:27 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.47

    Graham Barr discovered a problem where shutdown_output() was causing
    IIS servers to disconnect before sending responses. He suspects it's
    a race condition that only shows up over connections with
    Internet-scale latency. It didn't appear in localhost testing.
    Nevertheless, this isn't the first time where shutdown_output()
    caused problems, so I've left the call in a comment and clearly
    marked why it's that way. 

  2003-11-29 06:17:18 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.46

    Apply Richard Harmon's patch, rt.cpan.org ticket 4521, to support
    "ICY" http status lines. These apparently are Shoutcast mp3 streams.

  2003-11-22 06:02:39 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.45; t/01_request.t 1.16

    Jeff (last name lost) discovered that redirects weren't properly
    setting the Host header for the new location. This commit fixes his
    rt.cpan.org ticket, number 3805. 

  2003-11-03 07:23:09 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.44

    "Jaymes" requested that the progress indicator return raw octets
    along with the progress information. We may later want to disable the
    HTTP::Response, or to disable content building for it, to do
    progressive or streaming downloads of large things. 

=========================
2003-10-30 23:21:30 v0_57
=========================

  2003-10-30 23:21:30 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.43

    Bump version for release. 

  2003-10-19 20:02:36 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.42

    Add preliminary support for HTTP::HeadParser, which should better
    update base() and related headers in the HTTP::Response objects. 

  2003-10-19 20:01:55 by rcaputo; SSL.pm 1.5

    Alter the READ (and add a WRITE) function so they better follow the
    sysread() and syswrite() interfaces. 

  2003-10-19 20:01:09 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.19

    Update the current versions of dependencies I have been testing with. 

  2003-10-19 16:31:10 by rcaputo
  Makefile.PL 1.18; mylib/ExtUtils/AutoInstall.pm 1.1

    Upgrade ExtUtils::AutoInstall to 0.54 

  2003-10-17 05:11:01 by rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.41

    Alan Hasting discovered an error in the bitmap for the redirect phase
    of HTTP parsing. This should fix that error.
    
    Also we are now using delay_adjust() since it's available in POE
    0.27. This should avoid the potential for bad timeouts during long
    downloads. 

  2003-10-17 05:09:27 by rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.15

    Remove some debugging code. 

  2003-10-17 05:08:49 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.17

    We are now relying on a feature of POE 0.27. Bump up the dependency
    version number.
