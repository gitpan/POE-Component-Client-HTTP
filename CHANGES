    Time for a new release!

  2007-02-10 07:34:04 (r309) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Sam Lowry and Alexander Alexeychuk pointed out that sometimes pages
    redirect to http:///something ... and the component fails because the
    host segment on the URL doesn't exist. This is their recommended fix:
    To check for the undefined host and throw a "bad request" response if
    it's provided.
    
    A better solution might be to default redirects to the same host if
    no host is provided, even if the URL is explicitly http:///something.
    That's not included, however. 

  2007-02-09 07:14:18 (r308) by rcaputo; t/01_request.t M; t/07_proxy.t M

    George NistoricÄƒ informed us that Squid throws a 503 response to a
    nonexistent host, which is odd because the proxy shouldn't be
    contacted if the host doesn't exist. Nevertheless, we'll go with
    that. Patch applied, etc.
    
    He also discovered that more proxy environment variables need to be
    cleared. I applied his change to the proxy tests. 

  2007-02-09 07:02:59 (r307) by rcaputo; t/01_request.t M

    George NistoricÄƒ pointed out that some proxies return code 503, which
    we're not checking for.

    Make the new chunked stream upload test unique. That is, make it

    Rob Bloodgood patched the gzip compression code to avoid compression
    when the user cares about the received content size. Compression
    makes the returned data size exceed the maximum request size in some
    cases, including one test case.

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/14_gzipped_content.t A; MANIFEST
  M; Makefile.PL M; lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Apply Rob Bloodgood's patch to transparently decode non-streaming
    content before it's returned. This gives us support for gzip
    compressed content. Resolves long-standing rt.cpan.org ticket 8454. 

  2006-10-18 16:02:05 (r293) by rcaputo

    Add more notes about compression options, but the feature's still

    Initial compression support. But it's broken, and I'm tired and can't
    fix it tonight. It's committed (albeit commented out) in case someone
    else feels like taking a stab at it before I get back to it.

    Pitufo asked in rt.cpan.org 20975 that the MaxSize limit not generate
    a 400 error on an incomplete response. After much deliberation, I
    decided that a 406 error (Not Acceptable) is more appropriate than
    "Bad Request". That's the extent of this change. His original issue
    (errors on truncated responses) remains, but I pointed out that HTTP
    Range headers can do what he wants without throwing errors. 

  2006-10-16 16:16:06 (r290) by jbisbee; META.yml M

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Apply a fix by Harish J P at Yahoo. He found a race condition where
    cleanup is sometimes performed twice on a request. The component
    would try to call methods on undefined data members the second time
    around, which is fatal. Resolves rt.cpan.org 21110.

    Close the connection when we abort reading the response in the middle
    (includes redirects and requests over the maximum length); fixes
    broken behavior where we might reuse the socket and take the rest of
    the response as our new response. This requires new functionality in
    PoCoCliKeepalive, so update Makefile.PL to reflect that.

    Modify some tests to make sure that $response->request() is defined
    in more obscure cases (various internal error returns, etc.) and fix
    some cases where it is not so the new tests pass. 

  2006-05-10 05:19:12 (r252) by woggle; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPHead.pm M

    Ryan Tate posted in <http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=539816> about a
    problem with timeouts. It turns out that when redirects created new
    internal requests, the old ones weren't being cleaned up. As a
    result, they had to time out before the component would stop. Thanks
    to Tony Cook for pointing me at this message.
    
    Also beefed up the debugging a little, and bumped up the version for
    a new release.
