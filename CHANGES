=========================

  2002-09-04 20:33:26; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.21

	Thibaut B discovered that Domino Go servers will send multi-line
	STATUS lines (probably in addition to multi-line headers). The
	component hadn't anticipated that, but now it's fixed. 

  2002-09-04 20:31:22; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.12

	Move to the new CVS log reporter. 

  2002-07-19 15:26:59; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.20

	Removed a spurious warn() left over from debugging. Bumped the
	version number to 0.46. 

=========================
2002-07-10 16:04:32 v0_45
=========================

  2002-07-10 16:04:32; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.11

	Mexnix noticed the POE::Kernel run() warning in Makefile.PL. This
	fix gets rid of that warning. 

  2002-07-10 15:27:17; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.19

	Increase the version to 0.45. 

  2002-07-10 15:26:49; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.18

	Generate HTTP 500 errors for https requests without Net::SSLeay,
	and for failed DNS lookups. Improve Net::SSLeay detection (watch
	the versions of modules as well as their presence). 

  2002-07-10 15:25:31; rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.10

	Skip the SSL test if Net::SSLeay isn't installed. 

  2002-07-10 15:24:45; rcaputo; SSL.pm 1.3

	Fix indenting. Nothing really changed here but whitespace. 

  2002-07-10 15:24:18; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.10; MANIFEST 1.6

	Make Net::SSLeay an optional dependency, not a mandatory one. Add
	in AutoInstall to make things easier. 

=========================
2002-07-10 05:22:50 v0_44
=========================

  2002-07-10 05:22:50; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.9

	Add a recent version of Net::SSLeay to Client::HTTP's
	dependencies. The dependencies include a recent version of
	Net::SSLeay::Handle, but it seems that isn't enough. 

  2002-07-10 05:21:40; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.17

	Randal Schwartz gave a compelling reason for Client::HTTP to do
	nonblocking lookups internally. This change adds that feature. 

  2002-07-10 02:30:19; rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.9

	Add a test case for Randal Schwartz's uncanonical URI bug. 

  2002-07-10 00:43:33; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.16

	Randal Schwartz noticed that Client::HTTP did not canonicalize
	URIs it's given. This fix does that. 

  2002-07-04 13:33:28; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.15

	Bump the version to 0.43 for release. 

  2002-07-04 13:33:03; rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.8

	I forgot to test for Net::SSLeay::Handle before testing https.
	The result? Mondo crashage at the CPAN testers. Oy! 

=========================
2002-07-03 05:14:04 v0_42
=========================

  2002-07-03 05:14:04; rcaputo; README 1.4; HTTP.pm 1.14

	Prepare for 0.42 release. 

  2002-07-03 03:55:16; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.13

	No noticeable changes. Everything I tried was simply ineffectual. 

  2002-07-02 21:33:39; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.12

	Update the User-Agent string slightly to follow Mozilla's format.
	Adds (rv:$VERSION) to the string. 

  2002-06-29 06:19:53; rcaputo; SSL.pm 1.2

	Remove WRITE (which is in Net::SSLeay::Handle) and do some other
	little cleanups. 

  2002-06-29 06:10:14; rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.7; HTTP.pm 1.11

	Cosmetic change that may facilitate changes later. 

  2002-06-29 05:50:38; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.8; MANIFEST 1.5;
  t/01_request.t 1.6; HTTP.pm 1.10; SSL.pm 1.1

	Add SSL support. https URLs should now be fetchable, albeit
	slowly. 

  2002-06-29 05:49:49; rcaputo; README 1.3

	Note that the tests require a working internet connection. 

  2002-06-09 18:45:37; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.7

	Fixed the CHANGES generation so that change logs are included in
	tarballs. 

  2002-06-09 18:45:01; rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.5

	Applied Ryan Briones' proxying support. Thanks, Ryan! Added a GET
	test (with parameters) to ensure that GET and POST parameters
	pass through proxies. 

  2002-06-09 18:45:00; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.9

	Applied Ryan Briones' proxying support. Thanks, Ryan! Added a GET
	test (with parameters) to ensure that GET and POST parameters
	pass through proxies. 

  2002-06-09 03:53:39; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.6

	Added a dependency for URI version 1.11. Newer versions of LWP
	require an interface change that exists in 1.11 but not in
	previous versions. 

  2002-05-22 04:00:55; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.8

	Apply ekkis' patch to add the request tag to the progress
	callback. 

  2002-05-19 02:47:43; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.5

	"make dist" fails if it can't find CHANGES (which is in the
	MANIFEST). Add a little bit of code to ensure CHANGES exists
	before "make dist" can happen. 

  2002-05-18 17:02:21; rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.4

	Added CHANGES.OLD, so people can see old stuff. 

  2002-05-18 17:02:01; rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.4

	Added "make dist" magic to auto-generate ./CHANGES with the last
	year's worth of changes. 

  2002-05-18 16:59:06; rcaputo; CHANGES.OLD 1.1

	Moved the old, hand-edited CHANGES to CHANGES.OLD. When the
	newest thing in it becomes a year old, it will be removed. 

  2002-05-18 16:58:07; rcaputo; HTTP.pm 1.7

	Implemented the Timeout parameter. Fixed content length
	calculations. Replaced deprecated FooState parameters with
	FooEvent. 

=========================
2001-12-06 16:21:12 v0_38
=========================

  2001-12-06 16:21:12; rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.4; HTTP.pm 1.6

	add code behind Timeout 

  2001-10-15 19:44:00; rcaputo; t/01_request.t 1.3; HTTP.pm 1.5

	add maxsize ability
