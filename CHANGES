    Use the latest POE::Component::Client::Keepalive, too.

  2009-07-28 06:20:01 (r368) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; Makefile.PL M

    Use latest POE, and prepare for a new release.

    Added a machine-readable repository directory to the distribution.
    Documented the bug tracker, repository, and other resource URLs. 

  2009-07-26 23:03:04 (r366) by rcaputo; t/59_incomplete_b.t A

    Forgot to add this test in the last commit.

    Resolve a long-standing debate between MaxSize and Content-Length
    headers. If the Content-Length is greater than MaxSize, or the length
    of the content is (in the case where there is no Content-Length
    header), then we return a 406 Not Acceptable error rather than
    truncated data.
    
    Users who want truncated data should issue range requests instead of
    relying upon MaxSize. Besides, MaxSize won't let you resume your
    request where it left off.

    Internal component errors are sometimes indistinguishable from
    external server errors. Add a bit of text to differentiate them.

    apply patch from Apocalypse to make invalid host test more robust

  t/57_pravus_progress.t A; MANIFEST M

    Add PRAVUS' test case and patch to return progress events even after
    a redirect. Resolves his rt.cpan.org ticket, #36627. 

  2009-02-19 05:20:37 (r359) by rcaputo

    Comment the RS_* states.

  2009-02-19 04:00:21 (r358) by rcaputo; t/01_request.t M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #41278, reported by Andreas J. König. The
    component test was timing out on his smoker, so I increased the
    timeout.

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/RequestFactory.pm M;
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #35951, reported by Dave Miller. We were passing
    Tag to POE::Component::Client::Request->new() when it wasn't
    necessary. 

  2009-02-18 17:36:32 (r356) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket #27643. When a server disconnects before
    responding, POE::Component::Client::HTTP returns a 406 error to the
    application. The "MaxSize" error was incorrect and has been replaced
    with "Server response is Not Acceptable". The surrounding logic has
    been simplified somewhat as well. 

  2009-02-18 07:29:34 (r355) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Clarify the docs per Evan Carroll's suggestion. Resolves rt.cpan.org

    Clean up several warnings introduced by recent POE changes.
    
    Apply Zhurs' patch to resolve rt.cpan.org tickets 43073 and 25855.
    POE::Filter::HTTPChunk would go into an infinite loop on bad chunk
    trailer data, but now it appears to be fixed. Thank you! 

  2009-01-06 03:11:42 (r353) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Doc fix. Client::DNS is used by Client::Keepalive and is currently
    not optional.

  2008-12-09 06:17:03 (r351) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; Makefile.PL M

    Time for a new release. Bump the version and fix dependencies.

  2008-12-09 06:10:50 (r350) by rcaputo; t/11_cancel.t M

    Switch a post() to call() to avoid dispatch timing errors that caused
    some machines to fail this test. I think it's the test's fault for
    being intolerant, and I'm not entirely sure the fix will work
    everywhere. 

  2008-12-09 05:44:46 (r349) by rcaputo; t/01_request.t M

    Fix a spurious test failure. Not all systems implement (or even
    enable) Nagle's algorithm the same way. This change makes
    t/01_request.t not as susceptible to packet transmission timing.
    Previously the test would fail of packets were combined (but succeed
    if, like on my development system, they were sent separately). 

  2008-12-09 05:29:27 (r348) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/RequestFactory.pm M

    Don't set a content length if the content is a reference. The content
    length would be the reference's stringified length rather than the
    length of any actual content. In the case of CODE references, content
    will be generated in chunks anyway. 

  2008-12-08 07:54:03 (r347) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Clean up the leaky ext_request_to_int_id in more places. Apocalypse
    suggested using the requesting HTTP::Request reference directly as
    the internal ID rather than mapping it. That bears some
    investigation. 

  2008-12-08 07:36:19 (r346) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    New version. RequestFactory doesn not like underscores in version
    numbers.

  2008-12-08 07:27:14 (r345) by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M

    Internal development release.

  t/01_stream.t M; lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M;
  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP/Request.pm M

    Move data cleanup for request_to_id outside wheel check blocks. The
    ID being cleaned up isn't a wheel's ID. Also renamed the data member
    for future clarity, as well as REQ_REQUEST (related).

  lib/POE/Component/Client/HTTP.pm M; t/53_response_parser.t M;

    Bump the version, depend on the latest Client::Keepalive, and fix a
    bit of tab damage. 

  2008-11-21 17:56:00 (r340) by rcaputo; t/01_ssl.t M

    Fix a test error... sourceforge returns a 302 now, not the 200 that
    we expected.

  2008-11-21 08:26:19 (r339) by rcaputo; t/03_head_filter.t M

    Don't use == to test for undef. 

  2008-11-21 08:10:14 (r338) by rcaputo; t/01_request.t M

    Fix an unexpected response triggered by the coderef content feature.
    Two separate packets were sent without coalescing. I have a feeling
    my "fix" isn't going to be good enough in all cases though... some
    systems may coalesce those put()s.

    Merge branch 'localtests'
    
    fix merge problems by deleting t/57_joel_immed_cancel.t since my new
    version of t/58_joel_cancel_multi.t does everything it does and more
    and by updating t/58_joel_cancel_multi.t to my version because the
    changes in trunk were assuming the non-local tests.
